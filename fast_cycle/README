Environment notes
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Throughly tested under Ubuntu 12.10 (GNU/Linux 3.5.0-45-generic x86_64).
2. There are noticed numerical issues under Mac OS X Version 10.9.3

---------------------------------------------------------
Usage
---------------------------------------------------------
Compile:
$ g++ -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -Wall -Wno-deprecated code/stc.c -o bin/solver

Run inference:
$ ./bin/solver <input-model-file> <input-evidence-file> <output-file> <time-budget-in-seconds> [options]

For example:
$ ./bin/solver ./data/1.uai ./data/1.uai.evid ./1.uai.result 3600

You may use an empty file (or a non-existing file) for <input-evidence-file>.

If you use this software, please cite [1]. If you use it with cycles turned on (default),
please cite [1] and [2].

---------------------------------------------------------
Options
---------------------------------------------------------

Currently we only support one option:
-c 1 : use cycles [default]
-c 0 : not use cycles
(append "-c 0" without quotes to the end of the command line)

If the cycles are turned on (default), cycles will be added to tighten 
the dual decomposition after the dual progress has almost converged. 
(It usually has no effect if the initial dual decomposition already 
gives rise to a tight bound.)

---------------------------------------------------------
Input formats
---------------------------------------------------------

We support two data formats

1. UAI format
   This format has been used in a number of competitions including UAI 2014.
   Explanations can be cound in the following link (or google "UAI format")
   http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vgogate/uai14-competition/index.html
   We also suport evidences in the .uai.evid format (also explained in the above link).

2. MAP format 
   A major limination of the UAI format is that, it does not allow factors to share parametrization.
   For example, if we have a huge grid MRF (in image applications) where millions of factors share 
   the same parameterizations (smoothness prior on edges), the UAI format would be result in 
   an unnecessarily large file. To that end we define a new plain text format for MAP inference 
   problems (the .map format). This format is explained in detail in MAP_FORMAT.txt.

---------------------------------------------------------
Output format
---------------------------------------------------------

The output format is the same as the required output format in the UAI competition
http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vgogate/uai14-competition/index.html
Basically it is a space separated line that includes:
the number n of model variables, and
the MAP instantiation, a list of value indices for all n variables.

---------------------------------------------------------
Standard output
---------------------------------------------------------

While running, our solver also produces standard output in the following format:

"%.2f secs, energy=%f, bound=%f, progress=%f, cycles=%d\n"

it shows:
(1) the current running time (in seconds)
(2) the current enery value (objective function that we try to minimize),
(3) the current lower bound on the energy value, 
(4) the relative progress in closing the duality gap in the last iteration, 
(5) and the number of cycle subproblems being used
